\textbf{Suggestions:} \quad \text{For future submissions, consider the following:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \text{Elaborate on the chemical compositions: Explain that water molecules contain two hydrogen atoms (which can be deuterium) and one oxygen atom, while graphite is composed entirely of carbon atoms.}
    \item \text{Discuss densities: Compare the densities of water and graphite to explain how many molecules (and thus atoms) fit into a given volume.}
    \item \text{Provide numerical examples: Use calculations to show the difference in the number of atoms per unit volume for a clearer understanding.}
\end{itemize}
